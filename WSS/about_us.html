    <p class="family_story">The Wassatch Shred Shop is a small buisness started by these 3 handsome young cousins
        in Draper Utah in the summer of 2020. The 3 of us are incredibly close and have enjoyed
        hanging out and skiing with each other for years. It all started with a dream and a conversation 
        on how dope it would be to own our own buisness. After planning and collecting all the things 
        we needed we got to work. We built our own ski racks for storing skis and custom benches for 
        holding the skis while we wax them. We currently opperate out of a garage but who knows 
        maybe that could turn into our own ski shop someday. </p>

<h1 class="JT">JT Ahlström -17</h1>
<img class="JT_img" src="./images/JT.png" alt="Best skier">
<p class="JT_bio">JT, arguably the hottest guy in his highschool 
    is the second oldest of the bunch. He is also the 
    professional skier of the WSS. He has been skiing
    ever since he could stand and crawling in the snow before that.
    Without JT's garage and tools we likely never could have
    brought the WSS to life. Not to mention JT's excellent skills 
    in wood working and orginization that kept us on track during development. 
</p>

<h1 class="Dallin">Dallin Bentley -17</h1>
<img class="Dallin_img" src="./images/Dallin.png" alt="I made this, I can say whatever I want">
<p class="Dallin_bio">Dallin has been skiing right behind JT for a couple 
    years now. He may not have the great skills Reed and JT posess but for what he lacks 
    Dallin makes up for in hard work and persistence. Dallin plays a large
    part in running the WSS. If you get your skis waxed or tuned through us,
    chances are Dallin will be the one to pick up, fix up, and deliver your 
    skis back to you as fast as his long legs will allow. 
</p>

<h1 class="Reed">Reed Ahlström -16</h1>
<img class="Reed_img" src="./images/Reed.png" alt="One sexy boy">
<p class="Reed_bio">Reed may be the youngest but is definitely the brain behind the WSS.
His incredible entreprenuership and technical skills played a huge part
in making the WSS a reality. Reed has been an avid skier most of his life but 
unfortunately had to take a break due to tearing his ACL in a skiing accident.
However, he has made a full recovery now and you can find him shredding the 
slopes on the weekends.
