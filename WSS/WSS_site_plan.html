      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hey do you like to ski or snowboard? Yeah? I bet you just absolutely send it all the time. But there is nothing worse than hitting rocks and getting scrapes in the bottom of your skis while you’re speeding down the mountain. Its such a hassle to get those scrapes repaired but when you work with the Wasatch Shred Shop you don’t have to worry about that anymore. We will come to you to pick up your skis and take them back to our shop and when they are done, usually in about 1-2 days we will bring them right back to your doorstep! We will wax the bottoms, fill any scrapes and sharpen your edges all at a competitive rate compared to other ski shops! 
        Our goal is to make enjoying the weekend on the slopes as fast, fun, and convenient as possible!
    </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience I will be looking for will be anybody who likes to ski or snowboard around sandy- draper Utah. Particularly those people who have hit rocks or branches and need their skis to be repaired or people who haven’t waxed their skis in a while and want to ski faster. We will gain a bigger audience by offering to pick up and deliver the skis from and to the owners home and make the process as convenient as possible.

        Ok so I made wireframes for all my pages but I did it on paper in my sketch book and I can't 
        get the photos in here but trust me they really helped a lot while I was making my website.
        I made some minor tweaks to acount for different screen sizes and images.
