<p class="introduction">Welcome to the Wasatch Shred Shop! Here we are committed to getting you down
    the slopes as fast as possible and as easy as possible. We know taking care 
    of your skis can be a chore when you have to bring them into a ski shop and have
    to wait days before having to go back to pick them up. With the Wasatch 
    Shred Shop, we will come to YOU and pick up/ work on/ deliver your skis whatever time is 
    most convenient for you!

<p class="fix">We will fix up your skis and snowboards no matter the damage! Whether you just need
    wax, your edges cleaned up or even scrapes/ gashes filled, we take care of
    it all! 
</p>

<p class="location">We are located in draper Utah and will be able to service most of those going to Alta ski resort 
    and Snowbird. Because we don't have a store front yet, we will pick up your skis
    and deliver them back to you you whenever you like at no extra cost! 

     If you are too far out of our range but would still like us to service your skis
    just ask us about it and let us see if we can accomodate you.

<p class="statement">Quality and customer satisfaction are our top priority. We oursleves are skiers
    and we know what a good ski looks/rides like. We take pride in making every
    ski that passes through our hands the best it can be. If we find any additional
    problems with your skis we will let you know and sometimes we even throw in a little
    p-tex for free because there is nothing more satisfying than handing off a 
    beautiful ski to a happy customer.
